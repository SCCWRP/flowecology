I just wanted to formally introduce myself and follow up with some specifics from Jenny’s email.  Feel free to give me a ring if any of this needs clarification: 7147553217

Our plan is to create an interactive data visualization tool that will enhance our understanding of climate change effects on riparian dependent species in the LA/Ventura region (examples here and here).  An objective of this deliverable is to present the information in a way that is meaningful to the interests of the advisory committee and others that can benefit from this project.  To develop our vision, we are asking for feedback that will help us understand the needs of our group and how this app can inform their interests.

•	What regulatory or management decisions do you anticipate would benefit from the results of this project on climate induced changes in flow and temperature on stream/riparian species?
•	What sources of uncertainty are of most concern to your decision making process (e.g. climate projections, water management, species occurrence, future invasions, etc.)?
•	What types of data/information output would be most beneficial to your work (e.g. raw data queries, graphs and plots that can be manipulated, interactive maps)?  -- please provide your top TWO choices.

These questions are purposefully general to help us develop a broad objective for the application.  We’ll use your feedback to develop a prototype that will be refined with help from the group as we move forward. 

I really appreciate your time in answering these questions and am looking forward to working on this interesting project.  

Best, 

Marcus

Hi Marcus, 

I just wanted to let you know I have this and am giving it some thought. I’m actually attending a meeting tomorrow to develop a collaborative approach to measuring and mitigating for Thomas Fire impacts to local streams. I also just read a really interesting report on extended impacts of invasive pests on willow forests in the Tijuana River Valley. I guess this is to say that I’m thinking about streamflow, sure, but also the more cumulative impacts of climate change on streams – I guess that might address your 2nd question.

I intend to keep mulling this over and will try to formulate a response for you next week, but I am really slammed, so you have my full permission to bug me if you don’t hear back.
